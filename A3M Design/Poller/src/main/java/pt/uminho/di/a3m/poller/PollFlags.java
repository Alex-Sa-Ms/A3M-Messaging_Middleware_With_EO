     * to the wait queue of a pollable, i.e., if the entry is added as exclusive or not.
     * The second reason is that an exclusive entry which the wake-up function returns
     * success, meaning it as accepted the task of handling the event(s), and then decides
     * to change its events of interest, may result in an event that should have been handled
     * to be dismissed. By dismissing the event(s), an exclusive waiter that would handle it/them
     * will not be woken up until a new wake-up call, therefore leading to inefficiency.
     * In the worst case, because the event was not handled, a deadlock may occur.

     * <p>To further elaborate on how this flag actually works
     * for the poller instances, what this flag does is inform

     * the availability of events of interest for the pollable
     * registered with this flag, upon which the availability of
     * the pollable is removed so that the remaining waiters do

     * removing the pollable from the ready list, another event
     * arrives for the same pollable, another waiter will perceive
     * the pollable as available. If avoiding this situation is desirable,
     * one should register the pollable with an additional flag, the POLLONESHOT,
     * which will remove the interest in receiving events for the pollable
     * until they are rearmed through the modify() method of the poller instance.
