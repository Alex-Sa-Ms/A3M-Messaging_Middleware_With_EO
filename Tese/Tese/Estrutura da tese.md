# 1. Abstract e introdução

**(ChatGPT)**
Here's a suggestion for structuring your abstract and introduction:
**Introduction:**

1. **Context:** Begin by introducing the broader context of distributed applications and the role of messaging middleware in simplifying development.
2. **Motivation:** Discuss the challenges associated with existing messaging middleware, specifically focusing on the limitations of ZeroMQ in dynamic environments and the need for a more robust solution.
3. **Problem Statement:** Clearly state the problems your research aims to address, including the challenges in selecting communication patterns and the limitations of existing middleware in handling network fault tolerances.
4. **Aims/Objectives:** Outline the main aims and objectives of your thesis, highlighting the development of a new messaging middleware with exactly-once delivery guarantees and improved adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

**Abstract:**
Compose a concise summary that covers the entire thesis, including key aspects such as the design and implementation of the new messaging middleware, the utilization of the Exon protocol, and the improvements over existing solutions. Mention the significance of your findings and how they contribute to the field of distributed applications.

By clearly distinguishing the introduction and abstract in this way, you provide readers with a structured overview of your thesis. The introduction sets the stage by explaining the context, motivation, and main aims, while the abstract provides a brief, comprehensive summary of the entire research.
